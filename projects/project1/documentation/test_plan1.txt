 1) Create a RecordLabel
 2) Print the Artists from the RecordLabel
 3) Add an Artist to the RecordLabel
 4) Add a Song to the same Artist
 5) Set the Song's views to something else
 6) Set the Song's likes to something else
 7) Add another Song to another Artist
 8) Set the second Song's views to something else
 9) Set the second Song's likes to something else
10) Print the Artists from the RecordLabel again
11) Remove all songs with fewer than M views
	This should be in between Song one's views
	and Song two's views. Song two should have 
	more views than Song one so that the next 
	step gives a more interesting result.
12) Add another Song to the second Artist
13) Print all Songs for the second Artist
14) End the program and check for crashes and 
	memory leaks. If none of either, then great!
