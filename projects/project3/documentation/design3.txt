The methods that the WebTable must have are as follows:
	 1) The no-argument constructor to allocate all required memory 
		and initialize values.
		Success/Failure Report: not applicable
		Abstract Concept Sheilding: no parameters are
			passed into this constructor. Therefore, there is 
			no concept sharing whatsoever.
		Recursive: no.
	 2) The destructor to deallocate all required memory.
		Success/Failure Report: not applicable
		Abstract Concept Sheilding: destructors do not 
			take in any parameters in C++ as far as I am 
			aware of. This is the same reason why the 
			constructor "shields" the caller, simply 
			because there is nothing to sheild.
		Recursive: no.
	 5) The hash function
		Success/Failure Report: not applicable
		Abstract Concept Sheilding: this method is private
		Recursive: no.
	 6) A method to add a key-value pair
		Success/Failure Report: if the key-value pair could be 
			added.
		Abstract Concept Sheilding: the key-value pair are passed 
			in, and nothing else.
			Recursive: no.
	 7) A method to get an array of Websites with a key
		Success/Failure Report: if the Website could be read.
		Abstract Concept Sheilding: only the key, array of 
			Websites, and the number of Websites are parameters,
			nothing else like a Node.
		Recursive: no.
	 8) A method to remove all Websites with a 1 star rating
		Success/Failure Report: not applicable
		Abstract Concept Sheilding: the only parameter is the key,
			which is just a cstring.
		Recursive: no.
	 9) A method to display all Websites with a key
		Success/Failure Report: not applicable
		Abstract Concept Sheilding: the only parameter is the key,
			which is just a cstring.
		Recursive: yes because I need one or more methods to be 
			recursive.
	10) A method to display all Websites
		Success/Failure Report: not applicable
		Abstract Concept Sheilding: no parameters means no 
			concepts to sheild.
		Recursive: no.

Notes:
	 1) None right now.

Data structures that will be used in the program:
	 1) WebTable
		 a) Node
	 2) Website
