The standard menu I have is being used, which I should 
most definetly wrap into its own class.

The options are:
 add  - "Insert a new website by topic"
 get  - "Retrieve"
 set  - "Edit"
 cull - "Remove"
 show - "Display"
 all  - "Display all"
 help
 exit

At the beginning of the program, the file contents
are loaded into the WebTable. You are then prompted to 
pick an option.

Choose any and, in fact, all of them. Try to break the 
program if you can; its resilienceis astounding.

Do each more than once in different orders each time to 
thoroughly check each outcome.

Surprise, surprise, it met all the criteria.
