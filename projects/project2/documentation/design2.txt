The methods that the CustomerQueue must have are as follows:
	1) The no-argument constructor to allocate all required memory 
		and initialize values.
		Success/Failure Report: not applicable
		Abstract Concept Sheilding: no parameters are
			passed into this constructor. Therefore, there is 
			no concept sharing whatsoever.
		Recursive: no.
	2) The destructor to deallocate all required memory.
		Success/Failure Report: not applicable
		Abstract Concept Sheilding: destructors do not 
			take in any parameters in C++ as far as I am 
			aware of. This is the same reason why the 
			constructor "shields" the caller, simply 
			because there is nothing to sheild.
		Recursive: no.
	3) A method to add a group to the queue
		Success/Failure Report: through the return value
		Abstract Concept Sheilding: a single group will be passed 
			in (mostly so there aren't a million different 
			parameters)
		Recursive: likely.
	4) A method to remove a group from the queue
		Success/Failure Report: through the return value
		Abstract Concept Sheilding: a group object will be passed 
			in and will be changed to the front of the queue if 
			it exists. The only things that the caller has access 
			to are the success of this function and the potential 
			group that is returned through the parameter.
		Recursive: likely
	5) A method to retrieve the size of the queue
		Success/Failure Report: not applicable
		Abstract Concept Sheilding: only returns the number of 
			groups in this queue, nothing else.
		Recursive: no.
	

The methods that the CustomerStack must have are as follows:
	1) The constructor to allocate the array with a given size.
		Success/Failure Report: not applicable
		Abstract Concept Sheilding: the size of the array is given 
		but not modified. This constructor will handle the details.
		Recursive: no.
	2) The destructor to deallocate the array.
		Success/Failure Report: not applicable
		Abstract Concept Sheilding: destructors do not 
			take in any parameters in C++ as far as I am 
			aware of. This is the same reason why the 
			constructor "shields" the caller, simply 
			because there is nothing to sheild.
		Recursive: no.
	3) A method to push a customer to the stack
		Success/Failure Report: through the return value
		Abstract Concept Sheilding: a single customer will be 
			passed in to stay consistent with the GroupQueue.
		Recursive: no.
	4) A method to pop a customer from the stack
		Success/Failure Report: through the return value
		Abstract Concept Sheilding: a customer will be passed 
			in to write to if the stack has at least one 
			customer. Other operations are only visible by 
			the stack.
		Recursive: no.
	5) A method to peek at the most recent customer
		Success/Failure Report: through the return value
		Abstract Concept Sheilding: a customer will be passed 
			in to write to if the stack has at least one 
			customer. Other operations are only visible by 
			the stack.
	6) A method to get the size of the stack
		Success/Failure Report: not applicable
		Abstract Concept Sheilding: only returns a value, nothing 
			else occurs.

Notes:
	1) Will likely wrap up the groups into their own struct/class.

Data structures that will be used in the program:
	1) GroupQueue
		a) Node
	2) CustomerStack
		a) Node
	3) Customer
		- this is just a struct to wrap a name and email into one 
		object to simplify some operations
