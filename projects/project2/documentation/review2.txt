1) How well did the data structure selected perform for the assigned application?
Both of the ADTs, the GroupQueue and the CustomerStack
worked exactly as intended without error. They worked 
quickly to get the expected results. All of the ways 
I could think of for them to not work, I tested and 
made sure that, if they didn't, that the errors were 
corrected.

2) Would a different data structure work better? If so, which one and why...
Instead of using both a Queue and a Stack, I would've 
used a Deque (pronounced Deck), a double-ended queue.
The GroupQueue's enqueue and dequeue would be directly 
mapped to the Deque's pushFront and popFront methods
respectively. Then the CustomerStack's push and pop 
would be mapped to the Deque's pushBack and popBack 
methods respectively. That way, only one data 
structure would've needed to be used instead of two.
On top of that, there would be decreased data copying 
as the CustomerStack copied the data in GroupQueue 
when that would not be the case had a Deque been used.

3) What was efficient about your design and use of the data structure?
While the Deque would've simplified many things, it 
is not 100% necessary for the completion of this 
simple concept. Perhaps, if the resturant were more 
popular, with hundreds of Customers, things would 
slow down. But since that is not the case with this 
assignment, it's perfectly fine.

4) What was not efficient?
However, all things considered, the Deque would've 
been ideal. Firstly, there would be less code. This 
would make it easier to A) program, B) debug, C) use, 
and D) grade. Secondly, it would decrease compile 
time, and while that's not much of an issue for this 
project, it very much is for projects I complete in 
my spare time that have upwards of 50+ files.

Side note, yes, I do in fact work on big projects 
such as 2D and 3D game engines. More often then not, 
I use C++, but occasionally I use Java because I 
find it fun to swap between the two.

5) What would you do differently if you had more time to solve the problem?
Had I paced myself better than I had, I would've 
improved the UI and made it easier to work with.
Although, since you are primarily grading the ADTs,
I doubt that will be too much of an issue, especially 
this time around.
