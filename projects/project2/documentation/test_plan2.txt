 1) Remember to print the Queue occasionally.
 2) Add a Group to the Queue with no contact info.
 3) Seat the group.
 4) Exit and check the customers.txt file for that Group.
    If it doesn't exist, then it worked. If it does, 
	then it's left over from a previous run.
 5) Add a few Groups all with and/or without seating 
	requirements or contact info.
 6) If customers.txt exists at this point, remove it.
 7) Seat exactly one Group with contact info.
 8) Contact them through a "promotional event" and check 
	the output file for their name.
 9) Add and seat a bunch of Groups without any 
	promotional events and exit.
10) Check customers.txt for their contact info in order.
	That is, the order the stack would store them where 
	the beginning of the file is the top of the stack.
