The methods that the WebTree must have are as follows:
	 1) The no-argument constructor to allocate all required memory 
		and initialize values.
		Success/Failure Report: not applicable
		Abstract Concept Sheilding: no parameters are
			passed into this constructor. Therefore, there is 
			no concept sharing whatsoever.
		Recursive: no.
	 2) The destructor to deallocate all required memory.
		Success/Failure Report: not applicable
		Abstract Concept Sheilding: destructors do not 
			take in any parameters in C++ as far as I am 
			aware of. This is the same reason why the 
			constructor "shields" the caller, simply 
			because there is nothing to sheild.
		Recursive: no.
	 3) A method to recursively destroy a WebTree (called by the 
			destructior).
		Success/Failure Report: not applicable.
		Abstract Concept Sheilding: this method is private.
		Recursive: yes.
	 4) A method to add a Website
		Success/Failure Report: not applicable.
		Abstract Concept Sheilding: the Website is passed 
			in, and nothing else.
		Recursive: no.
	 5) A method to remove all Websites with a given topic
		Success/Failure Report: not applicable
		Abstract Concept Sheilding: the only parameter is the 
			topic, which is just a cstring.
		Recursive: no.
	 6) A method to remove a Website with a keyword
		Success/Failure Report: returns if the Website was found
		Abstract Concept Sheilding: the only parameter is the 
			keyword, which is just a cstring.
		Recursive: no.
	 7) A method to get a Website with a keyword
		Success/Failure Report: returns if the Website was found
		Abstract Concept Sheilding: the only parameters are the 
			keyword, which is just a cstring, and the Website 
			to write to if found.
		Recursive: no.
	 8) A method to display all Websites
		Success/Failure Report: not applicable
		Abstract Concept Sheilding: no parameters means no 
			concepts to sheild.
		Recursive: no.

Notes:
	 1) None right now.

Data structures that will be used in the program:
	 1) WebTree
		 a) Node
	 2) Website
